# Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Assignment
# Bike Demand Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project aims to model the demand for shared bikes based on various independent features, such as temperature, humidity, season, and time of day. The linear regression model will help management understand how demand varies with different features, providing insights into customer behavior and demand patterns. By analyzing these relationships, the business can optimize its strategy to meet demand levels and customer expectations, including expanding to new markets.

## Objective
- To predict the demand for shared bikes using a linear regression model.
- To analyze how various independent variables influence bike demand.
- To provide insights that can guide business strategies, including pricing, availability, and expansion into new markets.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes features like:
- Year, month, hour, temperature, humidity, weather conditions, etc.
- The dependent variable: **Bike demand (count of bikes rented)**.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Analyzing correlations and visualizations to understand the relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Creating new features to improve model accuracy.
4. **Model Building**: 
   - Using Linear Regression to build a predictive model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like R-squared, p-values, and residual analysis.

## Key Insights
- Identifying features with the highest impact on bike demand.
- Understanding demand variations across different seasons, months, and weather conditions.
- Gaining insights into the dynamics of bike-sharing services in various environments, including potential markets for expansion.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Main programming language used for data processing and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Statsmodels/Scikit-learn**: For building the linear regression model and evaluating performance.
